== Overview

Converts Nepali Date (Bikram Sambat (BS)) provided to English equivalent date(AD)/Gregorian Date.

Nepali calendar does not have constant month lengths like the English calendar. The number of days in a month keeps changing, so we cannot create an algorithm to find the number of days in a particular Nepali month and year. I hope that a Nepali Calendar maker can  create an infinite calendar for the Nepali calendar. For now, we have to use a lookup table when converting Nepali dates to English dates. 

We have to find mapping of first day of Bikram Sambat (BS)'s year to equivalent Gregorian date.
Do this for every Nepali year you want to convert e.g. 2001 Baisakh 1 "13-Apr-1944" ……… ….
2068 Baisakh 1 "14-Apr-2011"

To know all the number of days in each month Following URLs can be helpful.

Steps involved in BS to AD conversion:

1. If we need to convert 2001 Ashar 6, find number of days elapsed since start of Bikram Sambat year(2001 Baisakh 1).
2. Ashar is 3rd month(Baisakh, Jestha, Ashar) of BS as depicted in table.
So number of days passed is 31+31+6-1 = 67(number of days in Baisakh+number of days in Jestha+month_of_day-1).
Where month_of_day is day of month which needs conversion. 1 is subtracted as Baisakh 1 has already included.
3. Add number of days elapsed to Gregorian equivalent date (13 April 1944) eg (13 April 1944)+67=19 June 1944. Which is correctly converted Gregorian date of 2001 Ashar 6.
